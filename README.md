# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Visual Basic for Applications, or VBA is built-in to Microsoft applications, and allows for automation of analyses, such as that "Steve" needed. "Steve" can reuse the code to perform analyses on any stock.

### Analysis and Challenges

Below are images showing elapsed run time for the script for 2017 analysis and 2018 analysis.

### Run time for 2017 analysis

### Run time for 2018 analysis

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The refactored code looped through the 2017 and 2018 stock data a single time. This required the use of arrays to store stock volumes, starting prices and ending prices.

## Results

Below is an image showing 2017 stock performance.

Almost all stocks performed well in 2017. Seeing how stock return cells are mostly filled with the color green suggests this is the case. DAQO New Energy Corporation had the highest-performing stock in 2017, as evidenced by their 199.4% return.

Below is an image showing 2018 stock performance.

Of the stocks that performed well in 2017, only RUN and ENPH continued to perform well. While ENPH stock had a 2018 return 47.6% lower than in 2017, the return for RUN climbed 78.5% over that from 2017 in 2018. In both 2017 and 2018, positive performance exceeded the opposite.

## Summary

### Advantages

Refactoring code is advantageous in that refactored code can perform more efficiently and can have greater readability. With increases in efficiency, the scope of the program can be enlarged without sacrficing too much speed. 

### Refactoring

The refactored code in VBA_Challenge.xlsm has the advantages of allowing "Steve" to automate analysis of more stocks than just the stocks analyzed in the original code without taking too much time. The functionality of the VBA_Challenge code was the same as that of the original code. The improved efficiency and constant functionality defines refactoring.
